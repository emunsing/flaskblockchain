# SETUP


## Local setup

- Clone github repository into a newly created folder: `$ git clone https://github.com/emunsing/flaskblockchain.git` 
- Create virtual environment by running `$ virtualenv env`
- Set environment variables by running  `$ source .env`
- Install required Python packages with `$ pip install -r requirements.txt
- Associate heroku repository by running`$ git remote add heroku git@heroku.com:flaskblockchain.git`
- Run a local server with `$ python flaskblockchain.py`
- Go to http://localhost:5000 and see results!


## What the files do:
Needed for Flask app:
- flaskblockchain.py: Needs to run the app, and provide handlers for http requests
- Config.py: Defines environment variables for different execution environments, to turn on and off different functionalities or logging levels. Not strictly required, but useful for having both development and deployment environments
- .env: Source this to set environment variables
- requiremens.txt: Generated by `pip freeze > requirements.txt`

Required for Heroku:
- runtime.txt: Specify the Python runtime environment
- Procfile: Required by Heroku to indicate the type of dyno to spin up, and what to run

# Notes: 

When creating a new app...
- In addition to installing Flask and other requirements, be sure to install 

## Setting up Heroku (one-time; should be done)
This assumes that you're using the command line:
- Create app with `$ heroku create myawesomeapp` where your actual app name replaces `myawesomeapp`
- Set environment with `$ heroku config:set APP_SETTINGS=config.HerokuConfig`
- Set buildpack with `$heroku buildpacks:set heroku/python`
- Set dyno scale with `$ heroku ps:scale web=1`
